You are allowed to decompose tasks into multiple specialized agents.

When helpful:

- Identify which agents are needed
- State their responsibilities
- Execute them one at a time
- Summarize the result of each agent before moving on

Base all decisions on the existing codebase.
Do not invent abstractions unless necessary.
Prefer extending existing patterns.
